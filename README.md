# Simple CLI Restaurant Ordering System

A basic command-line restaurant ordering system built with Python. This project allows users to select items from a predefined menu and calculates the total cost of their order.

## Overview

This script is a straightforward demonstration of fundamental Python concepts. It's designed for beginners to understand how to work with dictionaries, handle user input, and use conditional logic (if/else statements).

## Features

- **Menu Display:** Greets the user and clearly displays the available menu items and their prices.
- **Sequential Ordering:** Allows the user to order multiple items one after another.
- **Input Validation:** Checks if the ordered item exists in the menu and provides feedback to the user if it doesn't.
- **Dynamic Bill Calculation:** Keeps a running total of the order and displays the final amount to the user.

## Getting Started
